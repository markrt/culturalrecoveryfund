# culturalrecoveryfund

(readme updated July 2021)

This is a repository in which I undertake some analysis on data on the Cultural Recovery Fund in England. The Arts Council England data's derived from [here](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication/culture-recovery-fund-data), and the data on repayable finance, BFI, and NLHF is derived from [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-165-million-in-repayable-finance-announced-to-support-major-arts-and-heritage-institutions-as-culture-fund-marks-1-billion-milestone). 

(If you have data on Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, please tell me.)

The folder html_docs contains all the (still scrappy) documents with graphs, maps and tables.
